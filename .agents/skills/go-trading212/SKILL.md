description: Unofficial Go client for the Trading 212 Public API, generated with oapi-codegen from the OpenAPI document Trading 212 publishes. Package `trading212` (`github.com/psyb0t/go-trading212`) has a typed `...WithResponse` method for every endpoint: account summary, positions, open orders, limit, market, stop and stop-limit orders, order, dividend and transaction history, CSV report exports, exchange and instrument metadata, and pies. Prices and amounts are `float64`. Use when Go code needs to read a Trading 212 account or place Trading 212 orders, or already imports go-trading212.

# go-trading212

Unofficial, typed Go client for the Trading 212 Public API, in package `trading212` at the module root.

For install, the full operation list, pagination and response fields, see [references/setup.md](references/setup.md).

## Security & safety

- Trading 212 uses HTTP Basic auth: the API key is the username and the API secret the password. Read both from environment variables (`TRADING212_API_KEY`, `TRADING212_API_SECRET`). Never hardcode, commit or log them, and never print a request with its `Authorization` header.
- Requests go only to `https://demo.trading212.com` (paper trading) or `https://live.trading212.com` (real money). A key works only on the environment it was made for. Default to demo.
- Placing or cancelling orders and creating, updating, duplicating or deleting pies act on the account. Call them only when the user asked for that exact action, and use the live host only when the user said so.

## When to use

- Go code needs a Trading 212 account summary, positions, open orders or history.
- Go code needs to place or cancel Trading 212 orders or manage pies, at the user's request.
- The project already imports `github.com/psyb0t/go-trading212`.

## When NOT to use

- The code is not Go. This module ships only a Go package.
- You need a client maintained by Trading 212. This one is unofficial and not affiliated with Trading 212.
- You want to change the generated client itself. See `AGENTS.md` in the repo.

## Usage

```go
import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"os"

	"github.com/psyb0t/go-trading212"
)

auth := trading212.WithRequestEditorFn(
	func(_ context.Context, req *http.Request) error {
		req.SetBasicAuth(
			os.Getenv("TRADING212_API_KEY"),
			os.Getenv("TRADING212_API_SECRET"),
		)

		return nil
	},
)

client, err := trading212.NewClientWithResponses(
	"https://demo.trading212.com",
	auth,
)
if err != nil {
	return err
}

summary, err := client.GetAccountSummaryWithResponse(ctx)
if err != nil {
	return err // transport failure
}

if summary.JSON200 == nil {
	return fmt.Errorf("account summary: %s", summary.Status())
}

total := summary.JSON200.TotalValue // *float64

positions, err := client.GetPositionsWithResponse(
	ctx,
	&trading212.GetPositionsParams{},
)
if err != nil {
	return err
}

if positions.JSON200 != nil {
	for _, position := range *positions.JSON200 {
		fmt.Println(*position.Instrument.Ticker, *position.Quantity)
	}
}
```

Most response fields are pointers; check for nil before dereferencing. The error return covers only transport and decoding failures. An API error (401, 403, 429 and so on) comes back with `JSON200` nil: check `StatusCode()` and `Body`.

Some method names come straight from the spec's operation IDs and are generic: `GetAll`, `Create`, `Update`, `Delete` and `GetDetailed` are the pie endpoints, `Orders1` is the order history, `PlaceStopOrder1` places a stop order and `PlaceStopOrder` a stop-limit order.
